## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Fraud Detection System** using the [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection).  
The dataset is highly imbalanced and complex, simulating real-world online transactions.  
The goal is to build machine learning pipelines that can **detect fraudulent transactions** effectively while minimizing false positives.
